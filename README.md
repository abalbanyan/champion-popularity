# Hackathon Project
## League of Legends Champion Popularity

This WebGL project displays the most popular roles for each League of Legends champion, based on information
obtained from champion.gg, a popular League of Legends statistics website.

We illustrate this information by drawing differently-sized spheres above each of the champion icons. Each of the spheres
has a texture that corresponds to one of the roles that champion can play (e.g. Marksman, Middle, Top, etc.). The larger the 
sphere, the more popular that particular role is for that champion.

The scene can be explored using the ijkm keys, and can also be made brighter using the b and d keys. More controls
are described on the webpage itself.

The textures all are obtained from the League of Legends game directory.
